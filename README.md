## Rules of the Game

- The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous.
- The game begins with the player and the dealer each receiving two cards.
- The player goes first and can choose to 'Hit' (receive another card) or 'Stand' (keep the current hand).
- If the player's total exceeds 21 ('busts'), they lose the game.
- Once the player stands, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.
- If the dealer busts, the player wins. If both the player and dealer have the same total, it's a tie.
- If the player or dealer has a total of 21 with only two cards ('Blackjack'), they win automatically.
